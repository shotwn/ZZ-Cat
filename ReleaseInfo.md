#### About Windows SmartScreen Warning

 Binary release invokes smartscreen warning because I don't sign the executable. I rather not pay for hefty code signing certificates.

I pack EXE with AHK's internal AHK2EXE utility. If you have doubts about the executable you can download the source. Run the .ahk file directly from the source with [AutoHotKey v1](https://www.autohotkey.com/).
